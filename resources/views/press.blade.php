Vistaprint Dives Deeper<br> into Design
            </h5>
            <p class="text-dark">5 Oct 2020 | Melbourne, Australia</p>
            <p class="text-dark">Vistaprint, the marketing partner to millions of small businesses around the world, announced today it is joining forces with 99designs, a global creative platform that makes it easy for designers and clients to work together to create designs they love. 99designs has been acquired by Vistaprint’s parent company Cimpress and will operate both as part of Vistaprint and as a standalone brand.  </p>
<p class="text-dark">“The driving force behind Vistaprint’s future with 99designs is our passion to help small businesses,” said Robert Keane, founder and chief executive officer of both Cimpress and Vistaprint. “We know how critical great design is for entrepreneurs on their journey. 99designs and Vistaprint have shared values and vision to be a trusted partner to business owners and creators which lay the foundation for something bigger and more valuable than either of our teams could create alone.” </p>
<p class="text-dark">The combination of 99designs’ large network of talented freelance designers and Vistaprint’s more than 20 million customers will create a global platform which will make it easy for small businesses to access both professional design services and great marketing products in one place, and will provide freelance designers on the 99designs network the opportunity to work with Vistaprint customers. </p>
<p class="text-dark">Patrick Llewellyn, 99designs’ chief executive officer, said, “In a year when the whole world has had to work together online, 99designs’ mission of championing creativity to bring opportunities to people around the world has never been more relevant. We’ve been enabling remote creative connections for more than a decade and have seen firsthand how these fuel the success of small businesses and creators. Vistaprint’s belief and investment in both our team and technology is testament to the enormous potential in human-powered creativity, as well as the profound impact that great design has on a small business.”  </p>
<p  class="text-dark">With more than 20 million customers worldwide, Vistaprint offers an enormous selection of customizable design templates for marketing and promotional materials. Over the past few years, Vistaprint customers have increasingly leveraged its design services, accessing real-time graphic layout assistance. This program has become much loved by small business owners who turn to Vistaprint’s customer service team members for tasks that range from modifying an eye-catching banner to creating basic flyers or business cards. During the pandemic, customers have also flocked to Vistaprint’s “we design it for you” offering for the quick and easy layout of custom face masks. With the acquisition of 99designs, Vistaprint will expand to serve additional customer design needs. </p>
